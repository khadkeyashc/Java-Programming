# Java-Programming
This repository contains a series of Java assignments and demonstration programs developed using Eclipse IDE. The goal of these assignments is to practice and demonstrate core Java concepts including object-oriented programming, multithreading, interfaces, and basic GUI/event handling.

## Project Structure

- `src/` - Contains the source code files named `Demo1.java` to `Demo15.java`.
- `bin/` - Compiled `.class` files automatically generated by Eclipse.
- `.classpath`, `.project`, `.settings/` - Eclipse project configuration files.

## Topics Covered

Each `DemoX.java` file covers different concepts in Java. Here's an overview of the general topics included:

- **OOP Principles**: Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction, and Encapsulation
- **Interfaces and Abstract Classes**
- **Multithreading**: Custom thread classes, concurrency handling
- **Event Handling**
- **Basic Banking System Simulation** (e.g., `BankAccount`, `Account`, `SavingsAccount`)
- **Shapes and Geometry**: Demonstrations involving `Circle`, `Rectangle`, etc.
- **Animal Class Hierarchy**: Example of inheritance and method overriding

## How to Run

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open it in Eclipse IDE.
3. Make sure the project is recognized as a Java project (using the `.project` file).
4. Run any `DemoX.java` file to see the output of the specific assignment.

## Requirements

- Java JDK 8 or later
- Eclipse IDE or any compatible Java IDE
